# Banknote Authentication Using Decision Trees

This project involves training and evaluating a decision tree classifier on the [UCI Banknote Authentication Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication). The aim is to explore the performance, interpretability, and decision boundaries generated by tree-based models.

The dataset consists of 1372 instances with four numerical features extracted from images of banknotes:
- Variance of the wavelet-transformed image
- Skewness
- Kurtosis
- Entropy

Each instance is labeled as either:
- `0`: Fake banknote
- `1`: Authentic banknote

## Project Contents

- `decision_tree.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook containing all code, visualizations, and explanations.
- `data_banknote_authentication.txt`: The dataset used in this study.
- `README.md`: Description and usage instructions.

## Features Implemented

- Data loading and preprocessing using pandas
- Exploratory data analysis and pairwise scatter plots
- Model training using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn.tree`
- Hyperparameter tuning for:
  - `max_depth`
  - `min_samples_split`
  - `criterion` ("gini" and "entropy")
- Evaluation with:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion matrix
- Tree visualization using `plot_tree()`
- Feature importance analysis

## Instructions to Run the Code

1. Upload the dataset file `data_banknote_authentication.txt` to the same directory as the notebook or mount it in Colab.
2. Open the `decision_tree.ipynb` file using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Run the notebook cell by cell in order.
4. Make sure to install any required libraries if they are not already available:
   ```python
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## Results Summary

Both "gini" and "entropy" based models achieved high classification performance. Feature importance analysis showed that the `variance` feature was the most influential. The decision tree model provided a good balance between accuracy and interpretability, making it a suitable choice for this task.
